# IoT radio for Raspberry Pi
Uses pygame to play music from database on Raspberry Pi. Database and music files are currently local files, but could be stored in a cloud service.

Uses API to communicate with Android app. API commands can pause, skip song and dictate which songs are played next in a playlist.

Must have local environment IOTRADIO_API_DOMAIN with correct API address in Raspberry Pi.
